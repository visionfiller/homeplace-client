# HomePlace

My app solves the problem of those who want a change of scenery and are bored with the day-to-day of their house. With HomePlace, users can view and swap homes in the area for a mini vacation while still being home to go to work, eat at their favorite restaurants, and more. It offers the opportunity to visit parks or restaurants that were previously too far away because they were not in the neighborhood. Customers can swap homes that have pools, big yards, or better locations. It is a community-type system, and to participate in a swap, the customer must have their home listed.

## Key Features

1. **Home Swapping:** Users can list their homes and browse through available listings in their area. They can then initiate a swap with another user, allowing them to temporarily live in each other's homes.

2. **Expanded Experiences:** With HomePlace, users can explore new neighborhoods, visit parks, and dine at restaurants that were previously too far away to conveniently access on a regular basis. This enhances their day-to-day experiences and adds a sense of adventure to their lives.

3. **Home Criteria:** Users can specify their preferences and requirements for the homes they are looking to swap with. This may include features like pools, big yards, or better locations. The app matches users based on their criteria to ensure a mutually beneficial swap.

4. **Listing Requirement:** To participate in a swap, customers must have their homes listed on the app. This helps maintain an active community and ensures that there are enough options available for users to choose from.
